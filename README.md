# iqs - Image Quick Sorter

Image Quick Sorter (pronounced icks) is a small tool for injesting and tagging media into a year/month folder structure based on capture date and time. To sort media of different formats and with different date information, this tool allows date ambiguity to be quickly sorted for each media injested.

## Development Goals

- [ ] Basic UI implemented
- [ ] Basic backend functionality implemented
- [ ] Images previewed
- [ ] EXIF parsing and writing
- [ ] Copy/move mode setting
- [ ] Date entry and sorting
- [ ] Multi-image selection and processing

## Ideas

For ambiguous dated images (no EXIF capture time), in order to better view what is going on it might be best to have the images displayed in a list that shows the available dates and allows quick selection of any of the available dates. Then you could select multiple items in the list and set the same date.
